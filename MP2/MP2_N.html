<h2>Image 1:Chippewa Sign</h2>

I have chosen two pictures that feature our brand new 7-12 building at Chippewa Local Schools. I want to feature some of thes pictures in my final website and want to capture the new pride of the community. This project was a little more difficult then intended because 
the Ohio weather did not cooperate the way I wanted it too and it has been overcast for two whole weeks and was not able to get a good picture so I had to take my brand new Photoshop skills to the test. The first thing I did to the picture was crop it so that the sign would be the main focus
and as you can see, there is still some construction going on so I was also to get more of a rustic look. I was able to use the clone stamp and take out the vehicles in the background and was also able to use the curve feature to adjust the brightness. Since it was overcast, the sign was a lot 
darker on the top because of the shaddow so I tried to use the "Dodge" feature to try to blend out the shaddow and make the letters more legible. It looks a little sloppy, but it looks like it worked!!. The last thing I did was try to get rid of all of the weeds surrounding the sign and used the burn
effect to make the weeds look like the surrounding mulch.</font>

<h3>Image 2: New High School</h3>

<table border="0">

<tr>
<td><font face="cambria">
My second picture is of the front of the new 7-12 building and has its pride and joy in the tower in the middle of it. I once again used the "curve" feature and "crop" to make sure the building was the main focus. I used the "clone" feature to take out some of the unwanted signs. 
I went into this picture knowing that I wanted to do something different with the clouds in the top. I was able to google some features and ended up making a new layer and went to "layer mask" and "blend to overlay" with the gradient tool and was able to make the sky a little brighter
while also making the clouds pop a little more without messing with the brightness of the rest of the picture. I was also able to Create a couple of transparent chiefs to add to the top along with the words "Chippewa Chipps".
