I decided to do some audio that could be a brief introduction of myself for a future website.
I started it with the song "Cleveland Rocks" because I love Cleveland sports and I uploaded it from Itunes. 
From there, I used the selection tool and the time lapse tool to delete out sections of the song, but also time it up so it still sounded good. 
The intro to the Cleveland Rocks song is actually a lot longer then what it is portrayed on the site. I then went into the effect section and amplified the songs down
so that my voice could be heard but you could still hear the music in the background. I recorded and edited my voice on Audacity and was also able to fade in and out to mix between the two songs. 
My second song is the fight song at my school that I teach at.
